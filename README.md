# Flash Cards for Revision

This app is for revision and learning purposes, initially it will have a built in suite of questions relating to things we have learnt at Enspiral Dev Academy. 

We aim to have it be able to render appropriate questions based on what you are having difficulty answering.

Our questions initially will be stored in an array of 'question' objects, the objects will have an id, a question value, an answer value, the amount of times the question has been asked, as well as the amount of times the question has been answered correctly.

question {
  id: 1,
  question: "",
  answer: "",
  timesAsked: 1,
  correctAnswers: 1
}



## MVP 
-Render a flash card.

-Keep track of whether the answer was correct or not.

-Track the amount of times a user has gotten the question right or wrong.

## Stretch Goals

-Have an answer form a user can fill out to save notes for later.
